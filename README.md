# Challenge-Week-5
Week 5 Challenge for Code Bootcamp

This week’s challenge requires the student to create an application that can generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, responsive user interface, to ensure that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
